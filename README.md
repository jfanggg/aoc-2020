## About

This repository contains my Advent of Code 2020 code in Haskell. 
This is my first exposure to Haskell and functional programming in general, so the code might not be of the highest quality. 

## Advent of Code

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."
